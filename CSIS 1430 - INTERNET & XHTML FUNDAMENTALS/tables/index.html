                <td>In 2004, lead singer Anthony Kiedis released his autobiography,
                    which was titled <br>Scar Tissue. In the book, he explained some of the lyrics: "Sarcastic Mr.
                    Know-it-all" <br>is Dave Navarro, whom Anthony refers to as "the King of sarcasm."
                    "With the birds <br>I'll share this lonely view" was inspired by birds that Anthony saw while he was
                    <br>singing outside of Flea's house, and he also says that the line has to
                    do with how he <br>felt like an outsider, looking in. Anthony was introduced to pot when he was 12,
                    but
                    <br>he first got high when he was 4. He was walking down the street with his
                    dad, and <br>his dad blew pot smoke in his face. <a

                    1989, Ulrich describes the movie Johnny Got His Gun as having a similar theme, <br>and this was the
                    reason it was incorporated into the video.

        <h2>Why I chose these songs:</h2>
        <p>The reason I chose the songs in the table above, is because these are songs I play almost daily. The order
            doesn't matter, they aren't ranked in my table. <br>It was hard to condense my top songs
            into a list of 4, as I listen to almost every genre of music.</p>
        <p>Here is one extra video I found while searching for the videos in the table above. It's a guy performing Red
            Hot
            Chili Peppers song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2mkYv3JrjU">Can't Stop</a>
            , but on a 3 Neck Guitar</p>
