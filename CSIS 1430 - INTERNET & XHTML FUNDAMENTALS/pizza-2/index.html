                    Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a savory dish of Italian origin, consisting of a usually round, flattened base 
                    of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and various other ingredients (anchovies, olives, meat, etc.) baked at a 
                    high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. In Italy, pizza served in 
                    formal settings, such as at a restaurant, is presented unsliced and eaten with the use of a knife and fork. In casual settings it is 
                    cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.
