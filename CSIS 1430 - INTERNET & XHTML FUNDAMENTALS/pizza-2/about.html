                In restaurants, pizza can be baked in an oven with stone bricks above the heat source, an electric deck
                oven, a conveyor belt oven, or, in the case of more expensive restaurants, a wood or coal-fired brick
                oven. On deck ovens, pizza can be slid into the oven on a long paddle, called a peel, and baked directly
                on the hot bricks or baked on a screen (a round metal grate, typically aluminum). Prior to use, a peel
                may be sprinkled with cornmeal to allow pizza to easily slide onto and off of it. When made at home,
                it can be baked on a pizza stone in a regular oven to reproduce the effect of a brick oven. Cooking
                directly in a metal oven results in too rapid heat transfer to the crust, burning it. Aficionado
                home-chefs sometimes use a specialty wood-fired pizza oven, usually installed outdoors. Dome-shaped
                pizza ovens have been used for centuries, which is one way to achieve true heat distribution in a
                wood-fired pizza oven. Another option is grilled pizza, in which the crust is baked directly on a
                barbecue grill. Greek pizza, like Chicago-style pizza, is baked in a pan rather than directly on the
                bricks of the pizza oven.
                When it comes to preparation, the dough and ingredients can be combined on any kind of table. With mass
                production of pizza, the process can be completely automated. Most restaurants still use standard and
                purpose-built pizza preparation tables. Pizzerias nowadays can even opt for hi tech pizza preparation
                tables that combine mass production elements with traditional techniques.
